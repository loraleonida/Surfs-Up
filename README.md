# Surfs-Up

## Overview
In this project, Python, SQLAlchemy and Flask were used to analyze and visualize climate data in order to determine if Oahu, HI has the ideal weather for a surf and ice cream shop. In order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year round, temperature analysis was performed specifically for the months of June and December.


## Results


Three key differences in weather between June and December are:
- The average temperature in December is 71 degrees, while the average temperature in June is 75 degrees.
- The minimum temperature in December is 56 degrees, while the minimum temperature in June is 64 degrees.
- The maximum temperature in December is 83 degrees, while the maximum temperature in June is 85 degrees.

## Summary
Based on the summary statistics of the monthly temperature in June and December, the surf and ice cream shop has the potential to do well year round despite lower temperatures in December. In June, the standard deviation is 3.3 degrees and the mean is 75 degrees. Therefore 84.1% of the time in June the temperature would be above 71.7 degrees, which is good weather for a surf and ice cream shop. In December, the standard deviation is 3.8 degrees and the mean is 71 degrees. Therefore 68% of the time the weather is between 67.2 and 74.8 degrees. Although the lower end of this temperature range is not quite as ideal for surfing and ice cream, 50% of the days in December would be above 71 degrees, which is great weather for surfing and ice cream. The profits would not be as high in December based on temperature alone, but it seems there would still be enough warm days in December for business to last through the colder months.

Two more queries I would write in order to further my weather data analysis for June and December would be the daily wind speed, and the daily precipitation. When the weather is windy and when it is raining, it would probably affect the surf and ice cream shop sales. I would want to know how many days each month have high wind speed and how many days each month have high precipitation, in order to determine the number of days sales would be affected during June and December.
